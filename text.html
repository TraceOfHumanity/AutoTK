          Wediv>'re sure Volkswagen wasn't intending to hurt us so much by unveiling four adorable ID.Buzz concepts at
          the Hannover commercial-vehicle show. Yet, somehow it hurts to know that these cute and the ProMaster City—or

          The flex-cab concept, adapted by the Dutch company Snoeks, features a configurable five-seater layout for
          passenger transportation needs. The seats can be electronically folded, allowing the van to transition from a
          people carrier to a goods transporter. The paramedic version of the ID.Buzz, built by Bösenberg, has room for
          three people. The cargo area has been converted to be modular, able to store medical equipment and serve as an
          emergency work space. According to Volkswagen, the incorporated emergency light system runs on a different
          battery system from the rest of the car, meaning it will not hamper range in emergency situations.
